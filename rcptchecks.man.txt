NAME

 rcptchecks 
 
DESCRIPTION

  Warning: This plugin only makes sense if you are using vpopmail for all your domains.
  If you don't, it will mess your delivery, and bounce massive amounts of mail (most of it).

  The functionality and configuration is based on that of the chkuser patch from 
  http://www.interazioni.it/opensource/chkuser/

  This plugin makes some tests on the recipient of mails, and should be used on the
  RCPT command.

  * It will do some very basic validation of the recipient address, or will report
    511 Invalid address (#5.1.1 - rcptchecks)

  * It will only accept $CHKUSER_RCPTLIMIT recipients per message or report
    571 sorry, reached maximum number of recipients for one session (#5.7.1 - rcptchecks)
  
  * It will only accept $CHKUSER_WRONGRCPTLIMIT wrong recipients per message or report
    571 sorry, you are violating our security policies (#5.7.1 - rcptchecks)
    Note that it will give that message **even if subsequent recipients are correct**.
  
    Keep in mind that by "wrong recipients" we mean recipients with domains in your
    rcpthosts file who don't exist in your system.
  
  * It will bounce the message if the user is over his Maildir++ quota:
    522 sorry, recipient mailbox is full (#5.2.2 - rcptchecks)
    It will not handle system quotas or any other kind of quotas.
 
  You can also give a file with a list of domains for which no checks should be done.
  This is useful for domains for which you are secondary MX and have no way to verify the 
  addresses validity, or domains that are not on vpopmail.

REQUIREMENTS

  vpopmail. I repeat. Do NOT use this if you don't use vpopmail for all your domains.
  Really. I mean it.

  I will write the analogous plugin for non-vpopmail setups, but it doesn't
  exist yet.
  
CONFIGURATION

  It can be configured by setting the following environment variables:
	  
  CHKUSER_RCPTLIMIT  maximum number of recipients per message (default 10000)
  
  CHKUSER_WRONGRCPTLIMIT  maximum number of wrong recipients per message (default 10000)
  
  CHKUSER_MBXQUOTA  maximum percentage of accepted quota usage (default 100)
  
  CHKUSER_WLFILE is the name of a file containing a list of whitelisted domains
  for which all addresses are assumed valid.
  
LOGGING

  It will log information about each recipient::
	  
    rcptchecks: pid 2729 - Accepted recipient (test1@test.com number 3 of 20 )
    rcptchecks: pid 3474 - 511 sorry, no mailbox here by that name (test2@test.com)
    rcptchecks: pid 3457 - 522 sorry, recipient mailbox is full (test3@test.com)

ERROR MESSAGES

  Mostly they look the same as the log entries:
	  
    511 sorry, no mailbox here by that name (test2@test.com)
    522 sorry, recipient mailbox is full (test3@test.com)

BUGS

  There is surely some way qmail finds a local address we are not handling.
  Maybe aliases, subaddresses, default addresses, assign files, whatever.
