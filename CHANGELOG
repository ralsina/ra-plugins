CHANGELOG for the RA Plugin collection
======================================

* 2006-08-10 version 0.2.3

  + Added relevant qmrtg-based scripts to generate useful reports
    for some plugins. You need qmrtg for these to work: 
    http://dev.publicshout.org/qmrtg/

  + Made it mostly work with tcc (Tiny C Compiler), some linking
    problems remain for some plugins.

  + Switched to CMake as a build system
  
  + New plugin rcptchecksfile (alpha quality)

  + New plugin senderchecks (alpha quality)

  + New plugin senderchecksfile (alpha quality)

  + Changed behaviour of rblchecks and hardcoderbl. Now they close the
    connection if the IP is in RBL.
    
  + Changed behaviour of rblchecks and hardcoderbl: if the user is authenticated,
    they just exit, instead of giving an "A" command. This way they now do **NOT**
    disable other plugins.

    (patch by Miroslaw Lach)

  + Fixed case-sensitive comparison bug in rcptchecks.

  + Added domain whitelist to rcptchecks.

    rejecting permanently on DNS failure.
