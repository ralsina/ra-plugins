==== LibSPF2 ====

[[http://www.libspf2.org|LibSPF2]] is a library implementing support
for [[http://openspf.org/SPF]]. 

I am using it for my [[#spfchecks|spfchecks]] plugin.

Sadly, it is not well maintained, and the authors are not responsive.

Also, it doesn't work right in at least some cases.

So, I am looking for options to replace it.
