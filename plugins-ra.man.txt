NAME

  plugins-ra - A collection of qmail-spp plugins
  
DESCRIPTION

  This package provides several plugins meant to be used with a qmail patched using qmail-spp 
  (http://qmail-spp.sf.net).

  They cover diverse areas, and are meant to be written according to the following principles:
	
  * Good performance

  They are written whenever possible in C, and try to be short and direct.

  * Good logging

  They should inform the user of what they do. No email should ever be rejected without logging
  **something**. Also, all plugins logs include the PID of the qmail-smtpd process, so you can
  easily group all events of a connection.

  * Security

  Since writing in C exposes oneself to the dangers of memory corruption, I have tried to use,
  whenever it makes sense, the Better String Library, to avoid problems. While this makes the 
  plugins larger, it also makes me feel more comfortable.

  Also, for most plugins, it should be possible to run them as a very unprivileged user
  or in a chroot jail. This is not yet implemented, but it is worth thinking.
