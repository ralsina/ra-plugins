NAME

  plusaliases

DESCRIPTION

  Support on-the-fly aliases ala Gmail's plus sign trick.

  Often times users want quick throw away e-mail addresses that still get
  delivered to their account. Or they want a way to track what websites
  are spamming them.

  e.g. Register vapier+website.com@wh0rd.org and have it delivered to
  vapier@wh0rd.org automatically.

  This plugin should be used only on the RCPT command.

  This plugin should show up before the dotblind(8) plugin in the pathological
  case where the strip char and split char sets overlap.

REQUIREMENTS

  None.
 
CONFIGURATION

  You can set the PLUSALIASESCHARS environment variable to control the set
  of characters which act as delimiters for aliases. It defaults to "+".

  If you set more than one character, each is allowed to be a splitter.
  A setting of PLUSALIASESCHARS="+!#" will result in:

  vapier!moo@wh0rd.org -> vapier@wh0rd.org

  vapier+cow@wh0rd.org -> vapier@wh0rd.org

  vapier!moo+cow#fart@wh0rd.org -> vapier@wh0rd.org

LOGGING

  None.

ERROR MESSAGES

  Should never produce error messages.
