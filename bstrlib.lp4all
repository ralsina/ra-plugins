==== The Better String Library ====

Because I am conscious of my limitations as a C programmer, I have avoided 
handling strings whenever possible. It's fraught with risks, annoying,
and the standard library string API is incredibly ugly.

I have been lucky to find The Better String Library, which makes all that
uglyness bearable.
