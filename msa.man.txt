DESCRIPTION

  This plugin limits qmail-smtpd so that it works right as a MSA server.
  
  The MSA service is a lot like SMTP, except that it requires authentication.
   
  This plugin works by checking if the user is authenticated and closing the
  connection if he is not.
  
  You can read more about MSA at many places. It's defined in the RFC2476,
  called "Message Submission". You can read it here: 
  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2476.txt
  
  This plugin should only be used on a qmail-smtpd listening on the MSA port,
  and only on the MAIL command.

REQUIREMENTS

  It makes no sense if you don't have SMTP authentication on your server.
 
CONFIGURATION

  None.

LOGGING

  It will log every rejection:
	  
    msa: pid 4522 - Message rejected (no auth).

ERROR MESSAGES

  It will give the sender this message if he is not authenticated:
	  
    550 You should be authenticated
