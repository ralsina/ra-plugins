[@authlogger@]

=== AUTHLOGGER ===

  This plugin is meant to be used on the AUTH command and all it does is log the user 
  (see LOGGING)

== REQUIREMENTS ==

  None, but it makes no sense if your SMTP server doesn't support authentication.
 
== CONFIGURATION ==

  None.

== LOGGING ==

  It logs the authenticated user so you have more meaningful logs:
	
%%

    authchecks: pid 4077 - authenticated as testuser

%%

== CODE ==

- [[#authlogger.c]]

- [[#utils.h]]
