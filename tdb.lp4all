==== TDB ====

[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb/|TDB]] is a database with scope similar to GDBM or the old unix DBM.

The main advantages are that it allows for multiple simultaneous writers, which in a multiprocessing
environment like qmail-spp plugins is a huge bonus (you avoid using a daemon to serialize access).

It's nice. It's simple. It works. I like it.

For tasks where you need concurrent writing, (or just writing) to this kind of simple DBs, it's my
favourite choice.
