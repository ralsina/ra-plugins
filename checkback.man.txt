NAME

  checkback
  
DESCRIPTION

  Checkback is inspired by milter-sender (http://www.snertsoft.com/sendmail/milter-sender/)
  
  The main idea is that you don't accept mail from senders who are not willing to accept
  mail from you. To do that, this plugin attempts to send mail to the sender's address.
  
  It stops before actually sending, so it will not cause bounces or extra mail, but it will 
  connect to another server, so it is not free: it will add network load and server load.
  
  In some cases, such as when you are on a dynamic IP address and you usually forward your
  mail through another server, enabling this plugin will have terrible effects for you.
  
  When the check is successful, it will cache the sender's address for a configurable amount
  of time.
  
  Periodically you should run the checkbackpurge tool, or your cache will grow forever.
  
  This plugin is new, so consider it alpha quality at best.
  So, use with great care!
 
REQUIREMENTS

  This plugin is by far the most complex I have written yet, and it does some rather
  involved things. Since I am a chicken, I delegated all I could into libraries
  written by SomeOne Else (TM). The bad side is, that means it requires a
  lot of things.

  Since this needs to contact a remote SMTP server, it requires libSMTP 
  (http://libsmtp.berlios.de/) to actually handle all the difficult stuff.
 
  For the persistent cache mechanism, you need TDB (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb/) 
  
  You can whitelist domains and addresses. For those, no check will be performed.
  Usually, it should be a good idea to whitelist your own domains.
 
  It will add (at most) a few extra DNS lookups and an outgoing SMTP conection for
  each incoming mail. If the cache is functional, it should be less.

CONFIGURATION

  You can whitelist a domain by adding it in /var/qmail/control/cbwldom
  
  As of August 2006, you should whitelist yahoo, because it accepts messages
  for any address anyway. Probably yahoo.com and your local yahoo, too.

  You can whitelist a specific email address by adding it in /var/qmail/control/cbwladdr

  You can configure the cache database by setting the CHECKBACK_CACHE environment
  variable. The default is /var/qmail/control/checkbackcache.tdb .
  
  Make sure the user under which the plugin runs can modify that file.

  You can configure for how long to cache a successful check using the CHECKBACK_CACHETIME
  environment variable. This takes a value in seconds.
  
  For example, if you set CHECKBACK_CACHETIME=86400, successful checks will be cached for 
  a day. That's the default, too.
  
  The exact same environment variables control the cache's purging using checkbackpurge.
  
  So, for example, if you want to lose all the entries older than 2 hours on 
  /etc/checkback.tdb, you run it like this:
  
    CHECKBACK_CACHETIME=7200 CHECKBACK_CACHE=/etc/checkback.tdb checkbackpurge
    
  You should get something like
  
  checkbackpurge: pid 3267 - Traversed 7654 items, deleted 3244 items

LOGGING

  It will add a log entry for every message, explaining what heppened, or any error 
  conditions that arose.
  
  For this plugin this is specially important because it CAN make you lose legitimate
  messages. In fact, it probably WILL do that.

ERROR MESSAGES

BUGS

  No IPv6 support.
