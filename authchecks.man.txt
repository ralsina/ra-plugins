NAME

  authchecks
  
DESCRIPTION

  This plugin is meant to be used on the AUTH command and does two things:
	
  1. Logs the user (see LOGGING)

  2. If the user is authenticated, it sets QMAILQUEUE "/var/qmail/bin/simscan-nospam", 
  which is probably not what you want, but is what I use right now ;-)
  
  I implemented this plugin so I can have different processing for mails coming from 
  authenticated users. 
  For example, I use a simscan with spamassassin for regular mail and one without spamassassin 
  for authenticated mail.
   
  The usefulness of this plugin is limited, since you probably don't want to do exactly the 
  same thing I did ;-). If you want only the logging function, please check
  authlogger(8).

REQUIREMENTS

  None, but it makes no sense if your SMTP server doesn't support authentication.
 
CONFIGURATION

  None.

LOGGING

  It logs the authenticated user so you have more meaningful logs:
	
    authchecks: pid 4077 - authenticated as testuser
