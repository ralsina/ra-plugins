NAME

  rblchecks
  
DESCRIPTION

  This plugins is meant to be used on the MAIL command and performs a RBL check of the sender IP 
  address.
  
  If the sender IP is recognized by the RBL, it will close the connection.

  If the user is successfully authenticated, this plugin disables itself for the session. This is 
  necessary because most home IP addresses are listed in one RBL or the other. This behaviour,
  may become configurable in the future.

  It could be used at the HELO command, but then you have no way to allow access for your
  authenticated users.
 
REQUIREMENTS
 
  This plugin will add one or more DNS calls for every incoming connection, and one line of logging. 
  Other than that, performance impact should be negligible. If the RBL servers you use are down, 
  it will cause latency, but since that should never happen to authenticated connections, your users 
  should never notice it.
 
CONFIGURATION

  By default, rblchecks uses the bl.spamcop.net server, but you can configure it so
  it uses another server or servers by setting the RBLSERVERS environment variable
  to a colon-separated list of RBL servers. For example:
    
    RBLSERVERS="bl.spamcop.net:combined.njabl.org"
    
  In this case, the IP address of the sender will be chacked against bl.spamcop.net and
  then against combined.njabl.org.
  
  Whenever a server is listed on one of the RBL servers, an error message will be displayed 
  to the user, and no more checks will be performed, so it is ok to use more than one 
  server.

LOGGING

  It logs the result for every connection, like this:

	rblchecks: pid 17843 - No checks performed, because user is authenticated
	rblchecks: pid 11668 - 541 Blocked by combined.njabl.org (24.232.239.145)
	rblchecks: pid 2496 - Accepted 201.247.80.30
	
ERROR MESSAGES

  The sender will see error messages like the following:
	  
    541 Your IP (24.232.239.145) is blocked, more information at http://combined.njabl.org

  Or, if the RBL you are using provides descriptions, like this:
  
    451 Your IP (72.72.64.242) is blocked. Reason: Dynamic/Residential 
        IP range listed by NJABL dynablock - http://njabl.org/dynablock.html
    
    451 Your IP (72.72.64.242) is blocked. Reason: Blocked -
