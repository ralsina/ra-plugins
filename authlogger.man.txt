NAME

  authlogger
  
DESCRIPTION

  This plugin is meant to be used on the AUTH command and all it does is log the user 
  (see LOGGING)

REQUIREMENTS

  None, but it makes no sense if your SMTP server doesn't support authentication.
 
CONFIGURATION

  None.

LOGGING

  It logs the authenticated user so you have more meaningful logs:
	
    authchecks: pid 4077 - authenticated as testuser
