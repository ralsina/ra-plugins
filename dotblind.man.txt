NAME

  dotblind

DESCRIPTION

  Strip out dots from usernames ala Gmail's "dotblind" behavior.

  When dealing with names-as-emails, people can often typo the dot (either
  insert it when it doesn't belong, or omit it when it's needed). Rather
  than bounce things, strip it out and deliver away.

  e.g. With an e-mail account of michaelfrysinger@wh0rd.org, people can send
  e-mail to michael.frysinger@wh0rd.org or m.i.chael.frysin..ger..@wh0rd.org
  and have it go to michaelfrysinger@wh0rd.org.

  This plugin should be used only on the RCPT command.

REQUIREMENTS

  None.
 
CONFIGURATION

  You can set the DOTBLINDSTRIP environment variable to control the set
  of characters which get stripped out. It defaults to ".".

  If you set more than one character, all will be stripped out.
  A setting of DOTBLINDSTRIP=".~$" will result in:

  vap.ier@wh0rd.org -> vapier@wh0rd.org

  vapi$er@wh0rd.org -> vapier@wh0rd.org

  v.$ap.~$ier@wh0rd.org -> vapier@wh0rd.org

LOGGING

  None.

ERROR MESSAGES

  Should never produce error messages.
