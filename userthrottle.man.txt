NAME

  userthrottle 
  
DESCRIPTION

  This plugin allows the administrator to rate limit the connections from each 
  authenticated user.

  Every time the plugin is called, it checks $SMTPAUTHUSER against a running relayd and,
  if the configured rate is exceeded, it will terminate the connection after reporting
  a temporary error:
	  
    421 Too many connections. Please reduce connections per minute.
  
  You could use this plugin in different ways, I am sure you can come up 
  with others:
	
  * In the MAIL command, it lets you limit the mails per-user

  * In the RCPT command, it lets you limit the recipients per-user
  
REQUIREMENTS

  relayd (http://dizzy.roedu.net/relayd/) installed and running.
 
  The performance impact should not be great, in fact it should lower your load,
  since many address-testing spammers will be dropped, but try it and measure it 
  yourself.
 
CONFIGURATION

  Since it uses relayd, you configure the rates by configuring relayd itself,
  and you need to restart relayd whenever they change.

  Here is an example /etc/relayd/user.rules:
	
    joe@aol.com:100,5 # joe@aol.com will be limited to 5 relays per 100 seconds
    0.0.0.0/0:450,100 # default is 100 relays in 450 seconds

LOGGING

  If the configured rate is exceeded:
  
    userthrottle: pid 12345 - Rate exceeded per user (joe@aol.com)

ERROR MESSAGES

  Temporary error if rate exceeded:

    421 Too many connections. Please reduce connections per minute.
