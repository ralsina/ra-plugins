NAME

  localmail
  
DESCRIPTION

  This plugins lets you declare a list of your users as allowed for internal 
  mail only.
  
  That means that when they try to send a message to an address outside of 
  your domains, it will fail. They still can receive external mail, though.
  
  In fact, they can probably send email too, if they put their minds to it.
  
  They can do one of the following:
	  
  * Steal another user's password
  
  * Send directly bypassing your relay (so, block port 25 outgoing at the 
    firewall)
  
  * Send directly via MSA protocol (so, block port 587, too)
  
  * Use a webmail (so, block access to the web? or use a proxy, check logs)
  
  * Save the stuff to a damn floppy/usbdisk/camera/ipod/mp3 player/CD/DVD (I suggest
    cavity searches and huge electromagnets. Maybe doberman dogs?).
    
  Really, this plugin gives you just a false sense of security.
  
  How it works? It will check your SMTPAUTHUSER against a list stored in 
  /var/qmail/control/localonly and then, if the recipient domain is not in your 
  rcpthosts, it will reject the recipient.
  
  You should use this plugin only on the RCPT command.

  You should carefully disable unauthenticated relaying or this plugin is
  useless.
 
REQUIREMENTS

  Makes no sense if you don't have authenticated SMTP.
 
CONFIGURATION

  The LOCALMAILCONF variable contains the path to the config file. The default is 
  /var/qmail/control/localonly

  The control file should contain a list of users (as defined by your authentication
  mechanism), one per line.
  
  Example:
	  
    user1
    user2
    

LOGGING

  It will log every blocked recipient:
  
    localmail: pid 3245 - blocked from slave@fascist.biz to friend@free.world

ERROR MESSAGES

  If the plugin decides the recipient is remote and the sender is local-only, 
  it will give this error message:

    550 You are only allowed to send to local addresses.
